        I am Ginie and I live in the eastern part of the Netherlands together with my wonderful husband. Since childhood, I have been fascinated by jewellery. I used to make my own earrings, bracelets, and hangers. Hours and hours, I was busy with silver wire and small beads. Some of the beads were creative just like creating my own “trolls”. About 4 years ago, I discovered Trollbeads and was pleasantly surprised about how easy it was to create my own jewellery again! I found a new passion, and also an addictive one!

        The inspiration for the Piano bead came from my love for music. In the past, I have sung in some choirs and always loved it. Even though I never learned to play the piano, I have always been fascinated by the instrument.
