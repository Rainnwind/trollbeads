<p>"When I started collecting Trollbeads in 2009, I also fell in love with glass. I was so fascinated by those tiny, colourful and shiny artworks with the little flowers, stripes and their unbelievable depth effect that I could not stop gazing at all the little details again and again. In the same year, I took part in my first glass course. From the first moment on, I knew that working with glass was what I wanted to do from now on."</p>
<p>"Working with glass for me is something fulfilling and reflects my attitude towards life â€“ creating something beautiful. The material glass is so miscellaneous and exciting and gives me the room for creativity, which I was searching for a long time."</p>
