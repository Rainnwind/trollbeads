<p>Mary J (Jeannie) Sanger is from the Midwest of the US and loves to go on excursions and discover what nature has to offer. Especially waterfalls she finds fascinating. She is a glass painter and works for a local winery, hairstylist, and make-up artist, and there seems to be a commonality in her likes to make things look beautiful.</p>
<p>She has always been enjoying creating, anything whether it be drawing or rescuing an old piece of wood and turning it into a piece of art. She loves restoring antiques.</p>
<p>Jeannie has a passion for animals, especially dogs and Shih Tzus and Rottweilers are her favourites. Other passions are interior design, the royal family, scary movies, ghosts and haunted houses.</p>
<p>Jeannie discovered Trollbeads at Christmas in 2011 and she was hooked right away. She especially likes the ones that have a connection to who she is and her life experience.</p>
<p>Mary J (Jeannie) Sanger is&nbsp; one of the winners of People's Bead 2013 and designed <a href="/global/en-us/products/beads/11291(base_usd)" title="Leopard">Leopard</a> for the Traditional Sayings Collection.</p>
<p><em>“My family is my greatest gift, and spending time with my children and grandchildren are beyond words. When designing Leopard for the People’s bead, I chose the saying “A leopard cannot change his spots” because I felt it is important to be yourself and accept yourself and others. Besides, the leopard is such a beautiful animal, so I was glad they went hand in hand.”</em></p>
