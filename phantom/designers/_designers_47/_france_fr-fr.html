    All members of the Nielsen-Aagaard family have been involved in creating the anniversary bracelet.
    <br/>
    The Anniversary Bracelet symbolizes the flow of time. It reveals the 30 year history of Trollbeads in all its many shapes, colours and patterns; exhibiting Trollbeads' state of the art design and craftsmanship.

    From the beginning of life, peeping out from a pram, and the myriad of colours in the palette of the glass beads, to the reflection of textile design over three exciting decades. This period has also seen romance, mirrored in its flowers and trolls.
</p>
<p>
    The strong touch of Danish history and its tradition has not been forgotten. Denmark's famous Viking warships, once majestically decorated, are echoed in the beads. The bracelet is held securely together by a wise troll with 30 years in his backpack. And last, but not least, the golden "heart beat" in 18 carat gold adds the final touch to this exquisite bracelet.

<p>
    The Anniversary Bracelet is as unique as the history of Trollbeads. Every bracelet has its own serial number carried on an engraved bead. The assembled bracelet has a limited edition and is sold world wide. Only the chain and fresh water pearl will continue to be a part of the Trollbeads universe.
