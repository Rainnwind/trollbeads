    With complete freedom to draw inspiration from any corner of Chinese culture - from folklore and mythology in the depths of Chinese history, to the vibrant colours of modern day Chinese life - these six designers have created Trollbeads China - Limited Edition.
</p>
<p>
    The collection showcases just a few of the many vibrant facets of Chinese culture, from the awe inspiring Great Wall to the simplicity of the humble Silkworm, from the mythical creatures of Chinese folklore to the cheeky personalities of everyday animals.
</p>
<p>
    In between, wishes for happiness, love, success, and safe journeys are interspersed with vivid shades of Jade that explode like fireworks at Chinese New Year.
</p>
<p>
    Trollbeads China is a private glimpse into a rich and varied culture as seen through the eyes of the people that know it best.
