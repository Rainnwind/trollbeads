<p>To me, working with Trollbeads is very meditative. I create a sculpture or a small world in every bead. It pleases me to be able to dive in and work to the detail in a small scale in a world where we constantly receive lots of information and impressions. This is a unique chance for me and I appreciate it very much.</p>
