<p>Goldsmith, designer, scientist, inventor. It is not entirely obvious how to describe Morten Engell - Nørregård. His insatiable curiosity has always driven him to explore new ideas and seek new knowledge. He got his apprenticeship in 1999 from Melcher Copenhagen and then worked for a period at the model workshop of Georg Jensen. Here he decided to pursue a career in research and took first his master's degree in computer science and then a Ph.d. at Copenhagen University on physically based simulation of human movement, a topic that can be applied in the development of prostheses for the disabled as well as in robotics. He continues to work as a researcher, but has now also returned to his jewellers&nbsp;roots as a designer for Trollbeads.</p>
<p><em>"For as long as I can remember, I have always made things with my hands. Inspiration comes to me from everything that surrounds me and I have to channel it into objects and shapes. It's almost an involuntary process. In order to realize my ideas, I have always hunted knowledge of how different materials are processed, ranging from clay, wax, wood, and paper, to virtual 3D objects in computers. I will always return to metal though. There is something in the process of working with metal that never ceases to fascinate me.”</em></p>
