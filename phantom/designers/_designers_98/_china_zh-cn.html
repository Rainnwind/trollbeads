Whenever I travel I always discover something new. On one particular vacation I found myself walking through a tropical garden. The array of flowers and foliage fascinated me. I was particularly drawn to the Plumeria (Frangipani) and the Hibiscus flowers. They were in full bloom. The vibrant colours and delicate petals left a lasting memory. “</em></p>
