    &nbsp;It is unbelievably exciting for me to be to be a part of Trollbeads, especially since I'm a part of the third generation of Trollbeads artists in my family. There is so much history to Trollbeads and I have so many experienced Goldsmiths around me that I can learn from.

    When I make a bead, I try to give it life. There has to be a reason for the bead to exist. To me Trollbeads are not just jewelry - every single bead has a life, a soul and a history.
