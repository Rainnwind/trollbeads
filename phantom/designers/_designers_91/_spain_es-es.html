        I believe in love, courage, persistence and faith. I think that laughter is the best medicine and life should be lived to the fullest. I believe in the law of attraction.

    I was born in 1974 in Jaipur (India), which is the land of colour, culture, traditions and jewellery. This has always inspired me in one way or another and art has always been a hobby for me.

    Growing up in a place like this has definitely played a huge part in who I am today.&nbsp;
    <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 1.42857143;">
        Since childhood I have been passionate about art but never had the opportunity to present it. I never knew it would turn out to be a blessing in disguise that my husband and children motivated me and helped me fulfil my dreams. And my love for beads grew when I met Lise Aagaard around 2007. Without all of their support, it would not have been possible to get where I am.&nbsp;

    So here I am, showcasing my designs which are highly inspired from the richness of nature and reflect the colours of Indian culture. I feel blessed to be a part of the Trollbeads family.
