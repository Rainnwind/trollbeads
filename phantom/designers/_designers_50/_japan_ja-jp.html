        To create something lasting and share it with others is always something very special. I love to work creatively and be very involved in projects.

        You never really know where the journey will take you, just like "life" - which can also be an adventure. Sometimes you have to let your 'golden ball' sink to the bottom to find your very own special Frog Prince... a bit of magical energy, a bit of hope, a bit of amazement, and a lot of color and joy - that is me, that is my world, that, for me, is Trollbeads.
