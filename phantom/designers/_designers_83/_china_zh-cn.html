<p>Valentina Rocchi was born in Rome, Italy, and still live in this beautiful city with her parents and sister.</p>
<p>As a child she started playing violin and today she is a professional player and teacher. Music is on top of the list of her passions but she also loves reading, cooking, traveling and spending time with friends.</p>
<p>Valentina discovered Trollbeads in 2006 and her favourite bead is Seaman and Mermaid, but she also finds all the glass beads really fascinating.</p>
<p>Valentina Rocchi is one of the winners of People's Bead 2013 and designed <a href="/global/en-us/products/beads/11369(base_usd)" title="Love is blind">Love is Blind</a> for the Traditional Sayings Collection.</p>
<p><em>“As I knew that the competition would have the title of Traditional Sayings, I thought about something with a global and universal meaning, something that could have been easily translated in every language, and something that would be nice to have on my own bracelet. I truly believe... that Love is Blind!”</em></p>
