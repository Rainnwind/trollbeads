<p><em>“When I read the theme of the People's Bead 2013 I immediately decided what would be the subject of my proposal! I took my favourite books, I’ve stacked them and I started drawing! I love reading, immersing myself in the pages and traveling by my mind... I can’t do without it! ...and seeing a bead that represents all this things is for me a great achievement and emotion!”</em></p>
